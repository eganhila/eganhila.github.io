I'm Hilary Egan, a computational data scientist at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. My work focuses on leveraging applied AI and computational science to address critical challenges across renewable energy domains. This includes developing intelligent methods to bridge the gap between high-performance simulations and experimental results, enhancing the energy efficiency and grid integration of data centers, and developing autonomous laboratory technologies.


I hold a Bachelor's degree in Physics from Michigan State University and a PhD in Astrophysics and Planetary Science from the University of Colorado Boulder. Outside of work I enjoy all sorts of classic Colorado activities including rock climbing, mountain biking, and skiing – though I'll never say no to a good book either.

If you are a scientist, student, or potential collaborator interested in applying AI & computational science in renewable energy relevant domains, please reach out!
